Hello reader! My name is Sivan, and this is my Open Source Software Development
course website. I am a senior computer science student at CAS. I am also
pursuing a minor in Mandarin Chinese. My academic interests include programming
of all kinds, mathematics, Chinese language, and literature. My non-academic
hobbies include video games, listening to music, reading, and "ricing" a.k.a.
building and beautifying my laptop computer GUI.
